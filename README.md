# CompassTeens

This is a platform built for the [CompassTeens](http://www.compassteens.org/) organization. It is a tool that students can leverage to showcase their work and plan out their goals and achievments. Documenting what they will be working on and what has already been accomplished. 

This platform is currently handed off to another developer to continue development.

It was initially made at Random Hacks of Kindness 2015 in Ottawa.
